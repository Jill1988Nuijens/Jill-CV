        <h2> Hi, I'm Jill...</h2>
        <p>..and i'm up for a new challenge in my life. </p>
        <p> I am 34 years old was born in the Netherlands but for the last 6 years i have been happily living in
            Curacao,
            a small island in the carribean sea. </p>
        <p>Ever since i was 14 years old i started working in hospitality, mostly restaurants which i still currently
            do.
            However, from a very young age on i have been interested in webdesign and some ‘vanilla’ programming.
            At the moment i am studying software development at NHA what i really enjoy doing. <br>

            For now i am looking for a new opportunity to develop myself in those area’s.
            My main expertise at this moment is front-end webdevelopment but am currently learning more about back end
            and other programming languages through my study.
            You can find more information about my personal life here, what i did in the past and what i see for myself
            in the future. </p>
